        <h1>The Book of Programming</h1>
        <p>This website contains fragments from the Book of Programming, 
        an ancient tome lost to time.</p>
        <p>The book is said to have been written by a disciple of <a href=website/people/fu-tzu.html>Fu-Tzu</a>,
        the legendary master programmer.</p>
        <p>Currently, two sections have been recovered:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a section describing the two aspects of programming (data and control);</li>
            <li>a section reporting short-sayings and other wisdom of the master Fu-Tzu.</li>
        </ul>
